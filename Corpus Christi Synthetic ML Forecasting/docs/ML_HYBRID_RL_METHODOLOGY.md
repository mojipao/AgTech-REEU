## 1. Core Philosophy: Hybrid ML + Physics Approach

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Traditional ML approaches for agricultural data generation face two critical challenges:
- **Overfitting**: Complex variables like ExG (Excess Green Index) and soil moisture are difficult to model accurately with limited data
- **Data Scarcity**: Agricultural experiments are expensive and time-consuming, limiting training data availability

### 1.2 Hybrid Solution
The system combines:
- **ML Models**: For reliable, well-understood variables (Heat Index, ET0, Rainfall)
- **Physics Models**: For complex, biologically-driven variables (ExG, Soil Moisture)

This approach leverages the strengths of both methods while avoiding their weaknesses.

## 2. Data Sources and Integration

### 2.1 Historical Data Sources
1. **Corpus Christi Experimental Data** (2023-2024)
   - 11,233 rows of field measurements
   - Includes ExG, soil moisture, irrigation, weather variables
   - High-quality but limited temporal coverage

2. **27-Year Weather Dataset** (1998-2024)
   - 236,688 rows of hourly weather data
   - Temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation
   - Comprehensive historical patterns

3. **Lubbock Experimental Data** (2023)
   - 1,288 rows of complementary field data
   - Used for transfer learning and pattern recognition
   - Weighted lower than Corpus Christi data

### 2.2 Data Preprocessing
- **Temporal Separation**: Weather data pre-2023 used for ML training (anti-leakage)
- **Feature Engineering**: Realistic seasonal patterns from historical data
- **Quality Control**: Removal of outliers and missing values
- **Normalization**: Standard scaling for ML model training

## 3. ML Model Architecture

### 3.1 Model Selection Strategy
```
Variable          | Model Type | Rationale
------------------|------------|------------------
Heat Index        | Ridge      | High accuracy (R²=0.959), stable
ET0               | Ridge      | Good performance (R²=0.890), physics-based
Rainfall          | Ridge      | Poor but expected (R²=0.057), stochastic nature
ExG               | Physics    | Complex biology, ML overfits
Soil Moisture     | Physics    | Water balance, ML overfits
```

### 3.2 Anti-Overfitting Measures
1. **Strong Regularization**: Ridge regression with alpha=0.1-10.0
2. **Temporal Cross-Validation**: Strict time-based splitting with gaps
3. **Reduced Sample Sizes**: 5,000-50,000 samples instead of full dataset
4. **Feature Simplification**: 4-6 core weather features instead of complex engineered features

### 3.3 Training Process
```python
# Example training flow
1. Load historical weather data (pre-2023)
2. Calculate realistic seasonal patterns
3. Train ML models with temporal CV
4. Validate performance metrics
5. Save models for RL system
```

## 4. Physics-Based Models

### 4.1 ExG (Excess Green Index) Model
Based on Texas A&M cotton physiology research:

**Base Growth Curve**:
```
ExG_base = 0.1 + 0.4 × (1 - exp(-0.05 × days_after_planting)) + 0.3 × exp(-0.02 × (days_after_planting - 120)²)
```

**Temperature Stress Function** (Burke et al., 2003):
```
temp_stress = {
    1.0,     if heat_index < 85°F
    0.9,     if 85°F ≤ heat_index < 90°F
    0.7,     if 90°F ≤ heat_index < 95°F
    0.5,     if 95°F ≤ heat_index < 100°F
    0.3,     if heat_index ≥ 100°F
}
```

**Water Stress Function** (Ritchie et al., 2007):
```
water_stress = {
    0.3,     if soil_moisture < 100 gallons (wilting point)
    0.5,     if 100 ≤ soil_moisture < 150 gallons
    0.8,     if 150 ≤ soil_moisture < 200 gallons
    0.95,    if 200 ≤ soil_moisture < 250 gallons
    1.0,     if soil_moisture ≥ 250 gallons (field capacity)
}
```

**Solar Stress Function**:
```
solar_stress = {
    1.0,     if GHI < 400 W/m²
    0.95,    if 400 ≤ GHI < 600 W/m²
    0.9,     if 600 ≤ GHI < 800 W/m²
    0.85,    if 800 ≤ GHI < 1000 W/m²
    0.8,     if GHI ≥ 1000 W/m²
}
```

**Growth Stage Sensitivity**:
```
stage_factor = {
    0.3,     if days_after_planting < 30 (emergence)
    0.6,     if 30 ≤ days_after_planting < 60 (vegetative)
    1.0,     if 60 ≤ days_after_planting < 120 (flowering)
    0.8,     if 120 ≤ days_after_planting < 150 (boll development)
    0.5,     if days_after_planting ≥ 150 (maturity)
}
```

**Final Calculation**:
```
ExG_final = ExG_base × temp_stress × water_stress × solar_stress × stage_factor + N(0, 0.02)
```

**Temporal Continuity**:
```
if prev_exg is not None:
    max_change = 0.05
    change = ExG_final - prev_exg
    if |change| > max_change:
        change = sign(change) × max_change
    ExG_final = prev_exg + change
```

### 4.2 Soil Moisture Model
Based on water balance equation:

**Inputs**: ML-predicted ET0, rainfall, heat index, previous soil moisture
**Process**: 

**Crop Coefficient (Kc) Function** (Texas A&M):
```
Kc = {
    0.3,     if days_after_planting < 30 (emergence)
    0.7,     if 30 ≤ days_after_planting < 60 (vegetative)
    1.1,     if 60 ≤ days_after_planting < 120 (flowering)
    0.8,     if 120 ≤ days_after_planting < 150 (boll development)
    0.5,     if days_after_planting ≥ 150 (maturity)
}
```

**Actual Evapotranspiration**:
```
ETc = ET0 × Kc × 0.6  # 0.6 factor for realistic ET reduction
```

**Water Balance Equation**:
```
rainfall_mm = rainfall_gallons × 0.0037854 × 1000 / 36  # Convert to mm water depth
water_balance_change = rainfall_mm - ETc
```

**Soil Moisture Update**:
```
physics_adjusted_soil = prev_soil + water_balance_change
final_soil = 0.3 × physics_adjusted_soil + 0.7 × ML_predicted_soil  # Hybrid approach
final_soil = clip(final_soil, 180, 320)  # Realistic bounds for Corpus Christi sandy clay loam
```

**Field Capacity and Wilting Point**:
- **Field Capacity**: 250 gallons (optimal moisture)
- **Wilting Point**: 100 gallons (critical moisture)
- **Working Range**: 180-320 gallons (realistic bounds)

## 5. Synthetic Data Generation Process

### 5.1 Generation Workflow
```
1. Start Date: April 3, 2025 (actual planting date)
2. For each day:
   a. Get realistic weather from 27-year historical data
   b. Predict Heat Index, ET0, Rainfall using ML models
   c. Calculate ExG using physics-based model
   d. Update soil moisture using water balance
   e. Apply cotton physiology guardrails
   f. Add realistic noise and variation
3. Generate 212 days (full growing season)
```

### 5.2 Realistic Weather Sampling
Instead of sine/cosine patterns, the system:
1. Samples from actual historical weather data for the same date across 27 years
2. Preserves real weather variability and seasonal patterns
3. Adds small random variation (±10%) to avoid exact repetition
4. Maintains temporal consistency

### 5.3 Quality Assurance
- **Historical Data Preservation**: 100% preservation of original experimental data
- **Realistic Bounds**: All variables constrained to physiologically realistic ranges
- **Temporal Continuity**: Smooth transitions between days
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Matches Corpus Christi climatology
