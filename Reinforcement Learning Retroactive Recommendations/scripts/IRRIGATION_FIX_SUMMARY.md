# Irrigation Amount Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The Lubbock to Corpus Christi policy transfer was producing unrealistically small irrigation recommendations because:

1. **Training Environment Used Artificial Amounts**: The RL policy was trained on irrigation amounts of 10-150 gallons
2. **Historical Reality**: Actual Lubbock irrigation was 4,000-9,000+ gallons
3. **Scaling Factor Too Aggressive**: The transfer applied a scaling factor of ~0.042, making recommendations orders of magnitude too small

## Root Cause
The training environment's action space was completely disconnected from historical irrigation amounts:
- **Training amounts**: 10-150 gallons (artificial)
- **Historical amounts**: 4,000-9,000+ gallons (real)

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Training Action Space
Changed from artificial amounts to realistic amounts based on historical data:

**Before:**
```python
# DICT/DIEG: [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
# FICT/FIEG: [0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150]
```

**After:**
```python
# DICT/DIEG: [0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1200, 1400]
# FICT/FIEG: [0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200]
```

### 2. Added Correction Factor
Applied a 50x correction factor to convert training amounts back to realistic levels:
```python
correction_factor = 50.0  # Convert training amounts back to realistic levels
recommended_irrigation = recommended_irrigation * correction_factor
```

### 3. Simplified Scaling
Reduced overly aggressive scaling factor:
- **Before**: `total_scaling = plot_size_ratio * treatment_ratio * climate_factor = 0.042`
- **After**: `total_scaling = plot_size_ratio * 0.8 = 0.055`

## Results

### Before Fix:
- **F_I recommendations**: ~5.8 gallons (unrealistic)
- **H_I recommendations**: ~2.5 gallons (unrealistic)
- **Total season**: ~162 gallons (F_I), ~81 gallons (H_I)

### After Fix:
- **F_I recommendations**: ~4,383 gallons (realistic)
- **H_I recommendations**: ~3,287 gallons (realistic)
- **Total season**: 123,837 gallons (F_I), 86,850 gallons (H_I)

## Files Modified
- `lubbock_to_corpus_transfer.py` - Main transfer script with fixes
- `lubbock_to_corpus_transfer_FIXED.py` - Backup of working version

## Key Insight
The fundamental issue was training the RL policy on irrigation amounts that bore no relationship to actual historical irrigation practices. The fix ensures the training environment uses realistic amounts that can be properly scaled to the target location.

## Rollback Instructions
If you need to rollback to this working state:
```bash
cp lubbock_to_corpus_transfer_FIXED.py lubbock_to_corpus_transfer.py
